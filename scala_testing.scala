  /*
   * Example with a Unit Test
   * 
   * A convenient, quick-and-dirty way to experiment, especially with small code
   * fragments, is to use the interactive Scala interpreter.
   * 
   * To run a selection in the interpreter in Eclipse, highlight the code of interest
   * and type Ctrl+Shift+X (on Windows) or Cmd+Shift+X (on Mac).
   * 
   * Highlight the next few lines below to try it out.  The assertion passes, so
   * it appears that nothing happens.  You can uncomment the "bad test specification"
   * and see that a failed assert throws an exception.
   * 
   * You can try calling 'plus' with some arguments, for example, plus(1,2).  You
   * should get a result something like 'res0: Int = 3'.
   * 
   * As an alternative, the testPlus2 function takes an argument that has the form
   * of a plus function, so we can try it with different implementations.  For example,
   * uncomment the "testPlus2(badplus)" line, and you will see an assertion failure.
   * 
   * Our convention is that these "test" functions are testing code that are not part
   * of the "production" code.
   * 
   * While writing such testing snippets are convenient, it is not ideal.  For example,
   * the 'testPlus1()' call is run whenever this object is loaded, so in practice,
   * it should probably be deleted for "release".  A more robust way to maintain
   * unit tests is in a separate file.  For us, we use the convention of writing
   * tests in a file called LabXSpec.scala (i.e., Lab1Spec.scala for Lab 1).
